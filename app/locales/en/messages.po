The payer consents to processing of personal data provided in this mandate being handled by the payer's payment service provider, the payee, the payee's payment service provider and Bankgirot AB for the administration of the service. Personal data managers for this personal data processing are the payer's payment service provider, the payee and the payee's payment service provider. The payer may at any time request to receive access to or correction of the personal data by contacting the payer's payment service provider. Further information regarding the processing of personal data in connection with payments may be found in the terms and conditions for the account and in the agreement with the payee. The payer can at any time revoke his or her consent, which concludes the service in its entirety.</1><2>General</2><3>Autogiro is a payment service that means that payments are carried out from the payer's account on the initiative of the payee. For the payer to be able to pay through Autogiro, the payer must provide his or her consent to the payee that the payee may initiate payments from the payer's account. In addition, the payer's payment service provider (e.g. bank or payment institution) must approve that the account can be used for Autogiro and the payee must approve of the payer as a user of Autogiro.<4/><5/>The payer's payment service provider is not obliged to check the authorisation of or notify the payer of requested withdrawals in advance. Withdrawals are charged to the payer's account in accordance with the rules that apply at the payer's payment service provider. The payer receives notification of withdrawals from his or her payment service provider. On request of the payer, the mandate can be transferred to another account with the payment service provider or to an account with another payment service provider.</3><6>Definition of banking business day</6><7>A banking business day refers to all days except Saturday, Sunday, Midsummer's Eve, Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve or another public holiday.</7><8>Information on payment</8><9>The payer will be notified by the payee of the amount, due date and means of payment no later than eight banking business days before the due date. This can be notified prior to every individual due date or on one occasion concerning several future due dates. If the notification refers to several future due dates, the notification must be made no later than eight banking business days before the first due date. However, this does not apply to cases in which the payer has approved the withdrawal in conjunction with a purchase or order of a product or service. In such a case, the payer receives a notice from the payee regarding the amount, due date and means of payment in conjunction with the purchase and/or the order. By signing this mandate, the payer provides his or her consent to payments covered by the payee's notification in accordance with this section being carried out.</9><10>Sufficient funds must be available in the account</10><11>The payer must ensure that sufficient funds are available in the account no later than 12:01 a.m. on the due date. If the payer does not have sufficient funds in the account on the due date, it may mean that payments cannot be carried out. If sufficient funds are unavailable for payment on the due date, the payee may make additional withdrawal attempts during the coming banking business days. The payer can receive information from the payee upon request regarding the number of withdrawal attempts.</11><12>Stop payment (revocation of payment order)</12><13>The payer may stop a payment by contacting either the payee no later than two banking business days before the due date or his or her payment service provider no later than the banking business day before the due date at the point in time indicated by the payment service provider. If the payer stops a payment as per the above, it means that the current payment is stopped on a single occasion. If the payer wants all future payments initiated by the payee to be stopped, the payer must revoke the mandate.</13><14>Mandate's period of validity, revocation</14><15>The mandate is valid until further notice. The payer has the right to revoke the mandate at any time by contacting the payee or his or her payment service provider. In order to stop payments not yet carried out, the notice of the revocation of the mandate must be received by the payee no later than five banking business days before the due date or be received by the payer's payment service provider no later than the banking business day before the due date at the point in time indicated by the payment service provider.</15><16>The right for the payee and the payer's payment service provider to end the connection to Autogiro</16><17>The payee has the right to end the payer's connection to Autogiro 30 days after the payee has notified the payer thereof. However, the payee has the right to immediately end the payer's connection to Autogiro if the payer on repeated occasions does not have a sufficient account balance on the due date, if the account to which the mandate pertains is closed or if the payee deems that the payer should not participate in Autogiro for another reason.<18/><19/>The payer's payment service provider has the right to end the payer's connection to Autogiro in accordance with the terms that apply between the payer's payment service provider and the payer.</17><20>Pleo Autogiro \"Auto-Top Up\" Terms & Conditions</20><21>Notwithstanding the terms outlined above in the Section \"Information on Payments\" in order to provide you with the smoothest Wallet loading experience and to prevent potential declined card transactions Pleo may initiate payments both on the same business day as your Wallet balance falls below the threshold set and in accordance with obligations laid out in Pleo's general <22>Terms & Conditions</22> and <23>Terms of Service</23>. Pleo will advise you of the amount and date when such an \"automatic\" Wallet top-up is triggered.<24/><25/>If you believe any such payment to be unauthorised you, as a commercial entity, must advise us within 5 business days in order to facilitate a refund.</21>"
